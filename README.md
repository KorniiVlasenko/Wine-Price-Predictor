# Wine Price Predictor   


In this project I will apply EDA, preprocessing, XGBRegressor() and Cross-Validation. This is a purely learning project.    


The data was taken from the Kaggle database [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)  

### Problem statement  

> to determine the price of wine   
    
### Goals of this project   

* Practice EDA: Data Loading, Data Familiarization, Data Visualization;   
* Practice Preprocessing: Outliers Excluding, Missing Values Processing, Coding Categorical Variables;  
* Practice XGBRegressor() and Cross-Validation.   

### Steps   

* Data Loading   
* Getting Familiar with the Data    
* Selecting Features for Model Training    
* Splitting Data   
* Outliers Excluding     
* Missing Values Processing     
* Combining Small Categories    
* Coding Categorical Variables   
* Training the Model    
* Model Evaluation
